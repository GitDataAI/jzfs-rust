A key aspect of data sharing involves not only posting or publishing research articles on preprint servers or in scientific journals, but also making public the data, code, and materials that support the research. Data repositories are a centralized place to hold data, share data publicly, and organize data in a logical manner.

# Benefits of Data Repositories
* manage your data
* organize and deposit your data
* cite your data by supplying a persistent identifier
* facilitate discovery of your data
* make your data more valuable for current and future research
* preserve your data for the long-run
